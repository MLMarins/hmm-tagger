## Hidden Markov Models

This repository is part of the NLP program from Udacity. In the Jupyter Notebook, I'll use the [Pomegranate](https://github.com/jmschrei/pomegranate) library to build a hidden Markov model for part of speech tagging with a [universal tagset](http://www.petrovi.de/data/universal.pdf). 

Hidden Markov models have been able to achieve >96% tag accuracy with larger tagsets on realistic text corpora. Hidden Markov models have also been used for speech recognition and speech generation, machine translation, gene recognition for bioinformatics, and human gesture recognition for computer vision, and more.

### Usage

There are 2 notebooks

`HMM warmup.ipynb`:
This contains an introduction to HMM using the [Pomegranate](http://pomegranate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) library to build a simple Hidden Markov Model and explore the Pomegranate API.


`HMM Tagger.ipynb`: In this notebook, you'll use the [Pomegranate](http://pomegranate.readthedocs.io/) library to build a hidden Markov model for part of speech tagging using a "universal" tagset.
